        Can I use the images from NSSDCA's Photo Gallery or do I need 
        to obtain permission from somebody first?
        Unless otherwise noted, the images presented on NSSDCA's Photo Gallery 
        are in the public domain. As such, they may be used for any purpose. 
        NSSDCA does ask, however, that you acknowledge NASA and the NSSDCA as 
        the supplier of the data. In addition, where the source of the image 
        (by project or as a specific person) is credited in the text, you 
        should also acknowledge that, too.
